									<h6>University Project</h6>
									<h3>Chatbot</h3>
									<h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>
                This was a university project, which tasked me to work in a team and create a chatbot. So, we took on the task and when on with the various aspect of the development. Here, I will be explaining my own experience within the project development, as I was the scrum master (as we decided to use the agile methodology). The chatbot was done in the programming language Python 3. Our chatbot was a sport chatbot that can discuss topic on sports. My specific chatbot oversaw combat sports (more specifically boxing, UFC and wrestling).</p>

                <p style="color:#fff; text-align:left; " >The concept of the chatbot was discuss in our second weekly stand up. We decide to create a sport chatbot, which would allow each member of the team to focus on various sporting topics. For me this was my second team project, but for my team members it was their first. This was another reason, why I decided to break the bot into topics (as it would allow each team member to work on their task effectively). Thus, the team members went on and did their research on creating sport chatbots. In my case, I decide to have my chatbot to gather data from internet and then display the information as string data.</p>

            <p style=" text-align:left; " >My technical skills were dramatically improved, as I already had prior basic knowledge of programming, using C#, JavaScript and VB.net. Thus, I decided to play around with API and some GUI frameworks. However, before all of the coding started. I decided to divide my combat sport chat bot application, into two components (see Figure 1). The ‘Backend’ box represent the programming component that will oversee that the chatbot collects the data and store it (using API to collect data and then put in a simple text file to be retrieve and read from). The ‘Frontend’ box represent the interface the user will be using to communicate with the chatbot (GUI, Discord or Console Script).</p>
            <h3 style=" text-align:left; ">Python Modules</h3>
            <p style=" text-align:left; " >I divide python module into two sections. For the Backend development I decide that I need API that get data from the internet. I used Wikipedia (as it is the largest public information provider). I also used pyttsx3 to create a text to speech, as I thought it would make the bot interesting. There were other modules/APIs that I used to make the chatbot more interesting. Here are the module/API, I used:</p>

                <p style="color:#fff; text-align:left; " >This was the most important personal development to me, as my initial soft skills were not development that much. For the first time, I had to manage my team’s task using ‘dev. azure’. I had to create the sprints with assign time hours. Most weren’t followed, as we were an inexperienced team using the agile methodology to develop our software. However, the major improvement was my communication skills with the team. I learnt how to deal with various problem. For instance, some member did not have a very strong programming background, so in this case, I decide to create file that will contain all the functions that the team would use, via invoking the function into the own file they were working on (in python via the from filename import function). This allowed the team members to use the complex features in their bot.</p>

			  As I learnt how to manage my team members. 
			  I also had backup plans ready if the software was not going as planned. 
			  The project allowed me to understand, how the software development is done within a team environment. 
			  For instance, went creating the functions, I had to comment them, 
			  so the team members could understand what each function is does. If I left the comments out, 
			  they would not have a clue on how each function operates. 
			  Thus, allowing the development and creation of  the chatbot, to be simple and effective. </p>
